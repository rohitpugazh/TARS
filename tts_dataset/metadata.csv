tts_dataset\clip_0.wav| Hi, I'm Bill Irwin. I'm here at Theatermania today talking about building blocks of character physicality, especially as it bear-
tts_dataset\clip_1.wav| There's on physical comedy. Here we go. What part of the body do you work from? This end of the body if it goes...
tts_dataset\clip_2.wav| back and down, that tells a certain story. You meet somebody, how do you, whose center is back and down here, or if it's up and forward, that tells us.
tts_dataset\clip_3.wav| You can also decide what scale you're going to use them at. Within a thing that's clearly a comic fabric, you can give it.
tts_dataset\clip_4.wav| at a full breadth scale or you can work very very subtly for a kind of a end.
tts_dataset\clip_5.wav| just a slightest little adjustment of the center, either back and down or no. I see this thing here. It belongs to one of the camera gentlemen. They're hard.
tts_dataset\clip_6.wav| are beating faster, wondering what I'm gonna do with it. It's a thing that might have a life of its own. Whoa, but I have to keep...
tts_dataset\clip_7.wav| no matter how many takes they may need, I have to keep the idea of being surprised that it's going to go that way.
tts_dataset\clip_8.wav| Let's go that way. The innocence about what's going to happen next. I don't know what's going to happen. I'm actually going to make it happen by.
tts_dataset\clip_9.wav| pushing this hand that way. But I don't know what's going to happen, and I have to find a way to be surprised.
tts_dataset\clip_10.wav| I'm putting this back. You're always looking for what can go wrong. I'm gonna go off camera here, and as I cross, I'm gonna hope for, ugh.
tts_dataset\clip_11.wav| I was hoping there to be easy and now third time being the charm I'm going to show that I'm not going to be a
tts_dataset\clip_12.wav| That's what a limerick is, rhythm, rhythm. I really read the rhythm, reestablished.
tts_dataset\clip_13.wav| that rhythmic pattern. Baggy pants, the tradition of baggy pants. These things change what you see, gives you
tts_dataset\clip_14.wav| different silhouette. They also change the way my body feels and moves within them. I just think differently once these things go on.
tts_dataset\clip_15.wav| We were talking earlier about things going wrong, things not meeting the expectation, the smooth functioning of modern life.
tts_dataset\clip_16.wav| That's what the realm of clowning is all about. The difference between what you thought you would smoothly...
tts_dataset\clip_17.wav| and easily do and sometimes you get an unexpected victory out of you defeats now the most
tts_dataset\clip_18.wav| important part of clothing goes on the head, the hat. It's part of an extension of the brain. So when clowns are working with their hats,
tts_dataset\clip_19.wav| It's usually in the context of thinking. What am I thinking about?
tts_dataset\clip_20.wav| Or what is the nature of my hat? That's what I was after the whole time. And so my body starts to...
tts_dataset\clip_21.wav| think in different storytelling terms. It makes more sense to use these costumes this way than it does to stand.
tts_dataset\clip_22.wav| here and talk as if I weren't wearing them. Thank you. I'm Bill Irwin. That was a look at physical characterization, especially physical.
tts_dataset\clip_23.wav| and some building blocks, all part of the actors' crap.
tts_dataset\clip_24.wav| When training act was designed to get money into the economy, though it hired people, started giving them very modest paychecks, but regular...
tts_dataset\clip_25.wav| paychecks that they could count on for a certain length of time. And so within weeks of hearing about the job and of auditioning for the art commissioner.
tts_dataset\clip_26.wav| and going through my very cursory half day of orientation training. I was out there, well this is a wild time, it's the best of times.
tts_dataset\clip_27.wav| It's the worst of time. Most exciting time historically, it's also the scariest time on a downturn as they call it. And of course for somebody born in the...
tts_dataset\clip_28.wav| middle of the previous century, born in 1950, and I grew up on the privileged end of segregation or apartheid, if you want to use that word.
tts_dataset\clip_29.wav| This time and now is unimaginable. It's exciting. All that said, because a lot of people are saying that and they're saying it much better than I, but all that said, here's my great-
tts_dataset\clip_30.wav| I just hope for the new administration that the man in the White House is a good manager. He has a managerial challenge of historic proportions and I...
tts_dataset\clip_31.wav| When I voted for him, I thought, I think this is a very good man and a man who's a good manager, who's going to steward the people's money while...
tts_dataset\clip_32.wav| I think they would do well to look at arts programs, sending artists into the school, sending kids to see things that artists are doing.
tts_dataset\clip_33.wav| I think it's a good use of the people's money.
